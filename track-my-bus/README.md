# [Simple bus tracking app](https://ksaaskil.github.io/travel-planner-apps/track-my-bus)

### Known issues
- Currently contains updates from bus numbers 80, 82, and 83 (hardcoded)
- New updates from MQTT do not always appear or they appear very rarely and the app is basically broken. This will require debugging when I have time.
